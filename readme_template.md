#  Gradio: Build Machine Learning Web Apps â€” in Python

Gradio (pronounced GRAY-dee-oh) is an open-source Python library that is used to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications. 

With Gradio, you can quickly create a beautiful user interface around your machine learning models or data science workflow and let people "try it out" by dragging-and-dropping in their own images, pasting text, recording their own voice, and interacting with your demo, all through the browser.

Gradio is useful for:

* **Demoing** your machine learning models for clients / collaborators / users / students

* **Deploying** your models quickly with automatic shareable links and getting feedback on model performance

* **Debugging** your model interactively during development using built-in manipulation and interpretation tools

**You can find an interactive version of the following Getting Started at [https://gradio.app/getting_started](https://gradio.app/getting_started).**

##  System Requirements:

Gradio requires Python `3.7+` and has been tested on the latest versions of Windows, MacOS, and various common Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu). For Python package requirements, please see the `setup.py` file.
